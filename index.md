I am a Research Scientist in [Artificial Intelligence in Design (AiDLab)] in Hong Kong, working with Prof. [Calvin Wong](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/itc/en/people/academic-staff/?itcsid=4) and Dr. Aemika Zou. The research areas that I involved and interested include 3D Vision, Generative Algorithm and Fashion. In 2020, I completed my Mphil. degree from Xidian University under the supervision of Prof. [Rui Song](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/songrui/index.html). During my Mphil, I have visited The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data as a visiting student supervised by Dr. [Xiaoguang Han](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/hanxiaoguang/)
